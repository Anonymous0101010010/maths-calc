# Sine and Cosine Calculator

calcs cosine values for a triangle

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C code using your C compiler (gcc -o math_cal maths.c -lm) then do (./math_calc)
3. Run the compiled program.
4. Input the measures of two angles in the triangle.

The program will then calculate the third angle and provide the sine and cosine values for all three angles.

## Example

Suppose you enter the following angle values:
- angle 1: 30*
- angle 2: 60*

this will calculate the third angle as 90* and provide the sine and cosine values for all 3 angles.
